Hackerspace Adelaide - signup
=============================

<%= @greeting %> <%= @user.username %>,
Thank you for registering an account.

Your username is: <%= @user.username %>
Your user profile is: <%= user_url(@user, :protocol => "https") %>

If you'd like to buy a membership, please visit:
<%= memberships_url(:protocol => "https") %>

But it's totally fine to just turn up to a hack session and pay as you hack.

If you come across any problems, simply hit 'reply' to this
email and we'll reply as soon as we can.

Thanks again for registering.
Cheers, the Hackerspace Adelaide team.
